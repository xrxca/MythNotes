# FireTV Stick/Cubes as MythTV Frontends
FireTV's can be used as MythTV frontends, I've got a couple cubes that I run the full frontend on and a stick that runs the leanback version.

The MythTV wiki has a page [https://www.mythtv.org/wiki/Android](https://www.mythtv.org/wiki/Android) detailing the install, and some hints for best settings.
